Hi, I'm a programmer. I love the feeling of competition when it comes to programming. I believe in this thing, "Don't be a programmer, be a problem solver". I really love the feeling of competition when it comes to prgramming. I want to become a programmer who is capable of solving any problems.

I started with interest in low-end systems. Now that's part of my bigger ambition. I'm now learning web development along with native app development, with the intention of implementing AI in mind.

My goal is to see the day when AI overtakes hard labor and puts an end to human exploitation.
