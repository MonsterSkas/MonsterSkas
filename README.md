Hi, I'm a programmer, and a DJ/Producer. I love the feeling of competition when it comes to programming. I believe in this thing, "Don't be a programmer, be a problem solver". I really love the feeling of competition when it comes to prgramming. I want to become a programmer who is capable of solving any problems.
